Open Source @ Berkeley
Kyle M. Tucker

This is a locally hosted web-scraping program which pulls data from classes.berkeley.edu. 
It is capable of scraping data regarding class enrollment sizes, waitlist sizes, and class if enrollment is open.
This data is cached locally in a .txt file. This program also has a terminal-prompted setup that takes in class names, as well
as URL's of classes to be monitored. When updates are detected, the user is notified via text-message through Nexmo messaging
service.
